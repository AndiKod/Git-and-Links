# About

A little repo' to organise some usefull links (personal choices for a start) around stuffs like WebDev, Design, Tools and the future will tell _what else_.

With a breadcrumb on the top of each page, navigation, and internal folders/pages to come for more specific categs/links, it could end-up in some sort of tiny-tiny-tiny "Yahoo Directory" from the 90' :)

A looong way ahead, but could help me reach my daily web places, and help maybe others, so cool.
